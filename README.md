MeleF10Pro_for_Win_XBMC
=======================

An application to use Mele F10 Pro on XBMC in Win7,8,8.1

Mele F10 Pro it's an nice Air Mouse that works pretty good in Android but have no support for Windows so using it in XBMC system on wintel it's pratically impossible.
The remote sends commands that cannot be easily identified because are outside common standards so programs that remap keys will not work.<br>
Here's this application, just start up it when your windows starts (it will appear in application bar) and it will intercep nicely only Mele F10 Pro commands and translate in other commands.<br>

Here's the commands translated:<br>

Keyboard: No changes, will work as usual<br>
Mouse: No changes, act as normal mouse<br>
etc..<br>

The only changes are:<br>
+ became + so it will increase volume on  XBMC<br>
- became - so it will decrese volume on XBMC<br>
Light became c so it will act as information on XBMC<br>
Speaker will be bar so it will pause/unpause on XBMC<br>
The key behind - (don't know name) will be esc<br>
Telefone up will be Backspace<br>
Telephone down will be Tab<br>

If you have better ideas let me know and I recompile the exes<br>

Note:<br>
There's 2 executables, one for 32 bit systems and one for 64 bit systems, no Apple support, never, so don't ask!<br>
